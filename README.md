## Introduction
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset for classification, machine learning, and data visualization.

The dataset contains: 3 classes (different Iris species) with 50 samples each, and then four numeric properties about those classes: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width.

One species, Iris Setosa, is "linearly separable" from the other two. This means that we can draw a line (or a hyperplane in higher-dimensional spaces) between Iris Setosa samples and samples corresponding to the other two species.

Predicted Attribute: Different Species of Iris plant.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to gain introductory exposure to Machine Learning Classification concepts along with data visualization. The project makes heavy use of Scikit-Learn, Pandas and Data Visualization Libraries.
